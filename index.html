        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <img src="./images/photographer.jpeg" alt="photographer" />
        <p>
          My name is OKaroni Purity, and I am a professional photographer with a
          deep passion for capturing the beauty of the world around us. With 5
          years of experience in landscape, portrait, and event photography, I
          strive to create images that evoke emotion, tell stories, and preserve
          precious moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began with a simple love for nature and people, and it has
          grown into a fulfilling career that allows me to blend creativity with
          technical expertise. I believe that every photograph has the power to
          connect, inspire, and leave a lasting impression. Whether I'm
          exploring breathtaking landscapes or capturing intimate moments, my
          goal is always to deliver exceptional quality and artistry.
